      "             Trainwreck is a mind-bending hybrid with potent sativa effects that hit like a freight train. Mexican and Thai sativas were bred with Afghani indicas to produce this Northern California staple, passing on a sweet lemon and spicy pine aroma. Trainwreck begins its speedy hurtle through the mind with a surge of euphoria, awakening creativity and happiness. Migraines, pain, and arthritis are mowed down by Trainwreckâ€™s high THC content, and many patients also use it for relief of anxiety, ADD/ADHD, and PTSD. Trainwreck flowers finish up in early October outdoors, while indoor gardens are ready for harvest 8 weeks into flowering.\n",

Although its genetics are considered to be a mystery, it is believed to be an Indica-dominant hybrid with a 20:80 Sativa/Indica ratio. Its THC levels range from 18 to 25%, so it’s considered to be strong - but not too strong.\n",

      "Dutch Treat has a very distinctive and mouth-watering flavor. Its dense buds have a strong smell of sweet fruits, combined with a powerful pine and eucalyptus tree scent. Its intense lemon-pine flavor paves the way for sweet eucalyptus, with a slight undertone of sage.\n",

      "The Dutch Treat strain provides the user with a quick and strong cerebral high, causing feelings of euphoria, while at the same time having a powerful relaxing effect on the body.\n",

With origins that stretch back to the late 1980s, Cheese is said to descend from a Skunk #1 phenotype whose pungent aroma made it stand out. Breeders like Big Buddha Seeds later introduced Afghani indica genetics to increase Cheeseâ€™s trichome production and yields. The resulting hybrid is now well-known for its relaxed, happy effects that gently ease you into a blissful state of mind.\n",

      "The Lemon Kush strain is a cross between the popular Master Kush and Lemon Joy. There are some cannabis grower-specific variants, but the strain is relatively consistent, with sweet, zesty flavours of citrus. Our Lemon Kush review found the lemony scent worked very nicely with the earthy, grounded undertones reminiscent of Afghan Kush. The light green buds of the Lemon Kush are covered in deliciously frosted trichomes, which certainly proved mouthwatering for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effects\n",
      "The Lemon Kush effects included uplifting and decidedly creative feelings, with the stresses of the world melting away and putting you in the mood to innovate. If you’ve been feeling sour, then Lemon Kush effects will add some sugar to your lemonade. \n",
      "\n",
      "THC Content\n",
      "The Lemon Kush review determined a THC concentration of 16-17% and CBD levels of around 0.5%. This strain provides a mild high for people looking to relax after work, or introduce some positivity when they are feeling down. The Lemon Kush strain is a very pleasant high that will leave you feeling euphoric.\n",

      "             OG Kush is considered to be a hybrid which, depending on the breeding procedure, can either lean towards Sativa or Indica. It is generally believed that it is derived from the Chemdawg strain. OG Kush is quite potent, with THC levels reaching 27%.\n",
      " \n",
      "It has a pleasing combination of a pine-like, cedar taste and a light citrus twist.\n",
      " \n",
      "When it comes to the effects caused by OG Kush, they tend to be more cerebral than body-related. One of the common feelings experienced by users is strong euphoria. For this reason, OG Kush has been described as a happiness-inducing strain. Considering that it offers a potent body-numbing effect, OG Kush is generally recommended for evening use. \n",
      " \n",
      "As far as negative side-effects go, these can include mouth and eye dryness, and rare instances of paranoia and dizziness.\n",
      " \n",
      "In medical terms, OG Kush is used as an anti-depressive and for the treatment of bipolar disorder. In addition, it helps bring balance to people suffering from extreme stress, anxiety and even anger management issues. It has also long been one of the go-to strains for people experiencing PTSD.\n",

Many people report a ‘head high’ feeling that is well suited to hanging out with friends, visiting the outdoors and working on creative projects, like music or artwork. Sativa was discovered in 1753 by biologist Carl Linnaeus who identified the strain as a unique species. Today, Sativa thrives in warm climates around the equator in countries such as Colombia, Mexico and South East Asia. The easiest way to recognize the Sativa weed strain is that it simply looks like a tall, thin plant. The leaves are slender, and the plant itself can grow as high as 20 feet tall.

Indica has more THC than CBD, so if you are looking for a more psychoactive effect, try out Indica. This strain was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1785 when it was found in India. The Cannabis Indica strain is mostly found in high altitude areas with colder climates, in areas such as Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan and Turkey. Cannabis Indica can be identified by its short, bushy appearance and thick leaves.\n",
